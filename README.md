### what it is

Take a selfie from the foodalike app and find out what food you look like ;)

We chose 24 categories from the [food-101 dataset](http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) and trained a Convolutional Neural Network with ~ 65% accuracy. We then set up a python backend on heroku to handle http post calls to get predictions from the trained model. Our android app sends the user's selfie as an http requests to the backend and gets the category name as a response. It then outputs a short description
